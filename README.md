# Outbreak - a modular set of Max for Live Devices for Launchpad Lightshows

Outbreak is a set of Max for Live plugins whose purpose is to aid in quickly producing modular and responsive lightshows for the Novation Launchpad controllers with minimal effort. They can also be chained with other plugins outside the Outbreak set and the included Ableton MIDI effects. Outbreak devices are designed with performance and flexibility in mind, so they can be used for all kinds of different purposes.

## System Requirements

## Installation

There are no specific installation instructions for working with Outbreak, as it works out of the box no matter where you've placed it, but it is recommended to keep them inside the **Current Project** folder to enable easier sharing of your projects (the recipient will not need to download Outbreak separately, and the project will work out of the box provided the recipient satisfies the System Requirements). You can easily make your project folder perfectly shareable by selecting *Collect All and Save* in Ableton Liveâ€™s File menu.

## Usage

For detailed instructions on using Outbreak, refer to the latest [Documentation](https://github.com/mat1jaczyyy/outbreak/blob/master/Outbreak%20Documentation.pdf).
